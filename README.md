# PShellNetwork
Powershell Scripts to assist with networking.
First project is to detect the optimal MTU settings to reduce fragmentation that may cause delay/lag.  

I'm sure I will find more uses for powershell to optimize a network in the future, but I'm learning it on my own... it may take a while.

Suggestions welcome!
