# PShellNetwork
Powershell Scripts to assist with networking.

I'm still not sure how to use GitHub correctly, but I'm a network engineer that is starting to learn powershell.  These are some things I made that I find useful, or just created for the fun of programming.  A lot of them aren't meant for other people, so use with caution.
